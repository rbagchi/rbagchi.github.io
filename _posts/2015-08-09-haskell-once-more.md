title: Yet another vacation reading about Haskell
---
Seems that every several years I go over Haskell again.  This time I read about 80% of 
[Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).   Paid a lot of attention to functors, 
applicatives, and monoids.  As is the nature of Haskell, I felt simultaneously confused and a bit smarter.

Whipped up an [implementation](https://github.com/rbagchi/rbagchi.github.io/blob/master/haskell/send_money.hs) of the famous SEND+MORE=MONEY using the List Monad.
Hopefully some kind of idiomatic:  Wondering if there's some way to formalize choosing the digits without replacement.
